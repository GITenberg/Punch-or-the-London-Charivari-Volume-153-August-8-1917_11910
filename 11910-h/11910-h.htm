    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"No amount of War Office approval will make hens lay," says
    <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i>. These continuous efforts to shake
    our confidence in the men entrusted with the conduct of the War
    can only be regarded as deplorable.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A workman in a Northern shell factory has been fined five
    pounds for having his trousers fastened on with iron nails. Why
    he abandoned the usual North Country method of having them
    riveted on him was not explained.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Charlie Chaplin, says a message from Chicago, has not joined
    the U.S. Army. He excuses himself on the ground that Mr.
    Pemberton-Billing, who is much funnier, is not in khaki.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A woman told the Lambeth magistrate that her husband had not
    spoken to her for six weeks. It is a great tribute to the
    humanity of our magistrates that the poorer people should go to
    them with their joys as well as their sorrows.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Cruises on the Thames and Medway estuaries will only be
    permitted on condition that the owners of pleasure craft agree
    to increase the nation's food supply by catching fish. Merely
    feeding them will not do.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A man who was seen carrying a grandfather clock through the
    streets of Willesden has been arrested. It seems to be safer,
    as well as more convenient, to carry a wrist-watch.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Newhaven, it is stated, is suffering from a plague of
    butterflies. All attempts to persuade them to move on to the
    M&eacute;tropole at Brighton have so far been successfully
    resisted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Table-napkins have been forbidden in Berlin and special
    ear-protectors for use at meal-times are said to be enjoying a
    brisk sale.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When the fourteen-year-old son of German parents was charged
    in a London Court with striking his mother with a boot, the
    mother admitted that she had cut the boy's face because he had
    called her by an opprobrious German name. On the advice of the
    magistrate the family have decided to discontinue their
    subscription to the half-penny press.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"I should like to give you a good licking, but the law won't
    allow me," said Mr. Bankes, K.C., the new magistrate for West
    London, in fining a lad for cruelty to a horse. The discovery
    that even magistrates have to forgo their simple pleasures in
    these times made a profound impression upon the boy.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Herr Erzberger has expressed a desire for "half an hour with
    Mr. Lloyd George" to settle the War. In view of the heavy
    demands upon the Premier's time it is suggested in
    Parliamentary circles that Major Archer-Shee should consent to
    act as his substitute.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The idea of giving raid warnings by the discharge of a
    couple of Generals has been unfavourably received by the
    Defence authorities.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A German shell which passed through a Church Army Hut was
    found to have been stamped with the initials "C.A." in its
    passage through the building. The clerk, whose duty it is to
    attend to matters of this kind, has been reprimanded for not
    adding the date.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A small boy at Egham, arrested for breaking a bottle on the
    highway, said that he did it to puncture motor tyres. If the
    daily bag included only one Army motor-car, with nothing better
    than a Staff-Colonel as passenger, the entertainment was
    considered to be well worth the risk.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"If I saw the last pheasant I would kill it and eat it,"
    says Lord Kimberley. Food hog!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We hear that, as a result of Herr Michaelis' disclaimer, the
    Germans are about to appoint a Commission to find out who (if
    anybody) is carrying on the War.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Women have reinforced the bell-ringers at Speldhurst, Kent.
    As no other explanation is forthcoming, we can only suppose
    they are doing it out of malice.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A man charged at a London Police Court with being drunk
    stated that he had been drinking "Government ale." It appears
    now that the fellow was an impostor.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Another man who wrote a letter protesting against the
    weakness of the official stimulant inadvertently addressed his
    letter to the Metropolitan Water Board.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A correspondent who has just spent a day in the country
    hopes the Commission now dealing with Unrest will not overlook
    one of its principal causes&mdash;namely wasps.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There has been a great falling-off in the number of visitors
    to Stratford-on-Avon, and it is expected that a new and fuller
    Life of the Bard will shortly be published.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Surrey soldier, writing from The Garden of Eden, says, "I
    think it is a rotten hole, and I don't blame Adam for getting
    thrown out." Still it is rather late to plead extenuating
    circumstances.</p>

    <h2>THE KAISER'S ORIENTAL STUDIES.</h2>

    <p>A Distinguished Neutral, who has just returned from Germany
    after residing for some time in the neighbourhood of Potsdam,
    informs us that the KAISER has been taking a course of Oriental
    literature in view of his proposed annexation of India, and has
    lately given close attention to the works of Sir RABINDRANATH
    TAGORE. The Distinguished Neutral has been fortunate enough to
    secure the KAISER'S personally annotated copies of the Indian
    poet's <i>Stray Birds</i> and <i>Fruit-Gathering</i>. From
    these volumes we have the pleasure of reproducing a selection
    of Sir RABINDRANATH'S aphorisms and fantasies, accompanied in
    each case by the KAISER'S marginal reflections:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>"I cannot choose the best. The best chooses
    me."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>Very true. I never chose the Deity. He chose
    Me.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Through the sadness of all things I hear the crooning of
    the Eternal Mother."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>Sometimes, too, I hear the groaning of the Unforgettable
    Grandfather.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Life has become richer by the love that has been
    lost."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I wish I could feel this about America.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"'Who draws me forward like fate?' 'The Myself striding
    on my back.'"&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>That cannot be right. I always said I didn't want this
    War.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Wrong cannot afford defeat, but Right
    can."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>"This ought to console poor old HINDENBURG."&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Listen, my heart, to the whispers of the world with
    which it makes love to you."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I must pass this on to TIRPITZ.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"We come nearest to the great when we are great in
    humility."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>Quite right. I always make a point of acknowledging the
    assistance of my Partner.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"I shall stake all I have and when I lose my last penny I
    shall stake myself, and then I think I shall have won through
    my utter defeat."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I don't think.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"The noise of the moment scoffs at the music of the
    Eternal."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>All the same I could do with some more big
    guns.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"The Spring with its leaves and flowers has come into my
    body."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I dislike all Spring offensives.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Let me not look for allies on life's battlefield, but to
    my own strength."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I wonder where Austria would have been by now if she had
    taken this attitude.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Wayside grass, love the star, then your dreams will come
    out in flowers."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>That reminds me that I must write and thank TINO for his
    letter enclosing a bunch of edelweiss.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"My heart has spread its sails for the shadowy island of
    Anywhere."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>Personally I should be content with the solid island of
    Great Britain.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Woman, when you move about in your household service
    your limbs sing like a hill stream among its
    pebbles."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I have often noticed this in some of our Berlin butter
    queues.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Let my thoughts come to you, when I am gone, like the
    after-glow of sunset."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I doubt if this beautiful thought would appeal to LITTLE
    WILLIE.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>"'Who is there to take up my duties?' asked the
            setting sun.</i></p>

            <p><i>'I shall do what I can, my Master,' said the
            earthen lamp."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I shall make LITTLE WILLIE learn this bit by
    heart.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"The real with its meaning read wrong and emphasis
    misplaced is the unreal."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>Yes; it's very hard on WOLFF'S Bureau.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"My heart longs to caress this green world of the sunny
    day."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>I find it most unfortunate that all the best places in the
    sun should be already occupied.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"While I was passing in the road I saw thy smile from the
    balcony and I sang."-R.T.</i></p>

    <p>O dreams of the East! O Baghdad!&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"'The learned say that your light will one day be no
    more,' said the firefly to the stars. The stars made no
    answer."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>That's what I should have done, but MICHAELIS would keep on
    talking.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"God is ashamed when the prosperous boast of His special
    favour."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>This must be some other god, not our German
    one.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Power takes as ingratitude the writhings of its
    victims."&mdash;R.T.</i></p>

    <p>And quite rightly. That's all the thanks I got when my heart
    bled for Louvain.&mdash;W.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>"Kicks only raise dust and not crops from the

    <p>Very sound. Roumania has been most

    <h2>WAR AND MY WARDROBE.</h2>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>As I am not a banker or a high official swell,</p>

            <p>I never felt a pressing need for dressing extra
            well;</p>

            <p>And yet there were occasions, in days not long
            remote,</p>

            <p>When I assumed the stately garb of topper and
            frock-coat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>But war's demands, if you desire to tread the simple
            road,</p>

            <p>Are somewhat hard to reconcile with the Decalogue of
            Mode;</p>

            <p>So I gave away my topper to the man who winds our
            clocks,</p>

            <p>With a strangely mixed assortment of collars, ties
            and socks.</p>

    <h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

    <p>Out here the telephone exists largely as a vehicle for the
    <i>jeux d'esprit</i> of the Brass Lids. It is a one-way affair,
    working only from the inside out, for if you have a trifle of
    repartee to impart to the Brazen Ones the apparatus is either
    indefinitely engaged, or <i>Na poo</i> (as the French say). If
    you are one of these bulldog lads and are determined to make
    the thing talk from the outside in, you had better migrate
    <i>chez</i> Signals, taking your bed, blankets, beer, tobacco
    and the unexpired portion of next week's ration, and camp at
    the telephone orderly's elbow. After a day or two it will
    percolate through to the varlet's intelligence that you are a
    desperate dog in urgent need of something, and he will bestir
    himself, and mayhap in a further two or three days' time he
    will wind a crank, pull some strings, and announce that you are
    "on," and you will find yourself in animated conversation with
    an inspector of cemeteries, a jam expert at the Base, or the
    Dalai Lama. If you want to give back-chat to the Staff you had
    best take it there by hand.</p>

    <p>A friend of mine by name of Patrick once got the job of
    Temporary Assistant Deputy Lance Staff Captain (unpaid), and
    before he tumbled to the one-way idea his telephone worked both
    ways and gave him a lot of trouble. People were always calling
    <i>him</i> up and asking <i>him</i> questions, which of course
    wasn't playing the game at all. Sometimes he never got to bed
    before 10 P.M., answering questions; often he was up again at 9
    A.M., answering more questions&mdash;and such questions!</p>

    <p>A sample. On one occasion he rang up his old battalion. One
    Jimmy was then Acting Assistant Vice-Adjutant. "Hello,
    wazzermatter?" said Jimmy. "Staff Captain speaking," said
    Patrick sternly. "Please furnish a return of all cooks,
    smoke-helmets, bombs, mules, Yukon-packs, tin bowlers,
    grease-traps and Plymouth Brothers you have in the field!"</p>

    <p>"Easy&mdash;beg pardon, yes, Sir," said Jimmy and hung
    up.</p>

    <p>Presently the phone buzzed and there was Jimmy again.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, Sir, but you wanted a return of various
    commodities we have in the field. What field?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, the field of Mars, fat-head!" Patrick snapped and rang
    off. A quarter of an hour later he was called to the phone once
    more and the familiar bleat of Jimmy tickled his ear. "Excuse
    me, Sir&mdash;whose mother?"</p>

    <p>On the other hand the great Brass Hat is human and makes a
    slip, a clerical error, now and again sufficient to expose his
    flank. And then the humble fighting-man can draw his drop of
    blood if he is quick about it. To this same long-suffering
    Jimmy was vouchsafed the heaven-sent opportunity, and he leapt
    at it. He got a chit from H.Q., dated 6/7/17, which ran
    thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"In reference to 17326 Pte. Hogan we note that his date of
    birth is 10/7/17. Please place him in his proper category."</p>

    <p>To which Jimmy replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"As according to your showing 17326 Pte. Hogan will not be
    born for another four days we are placed in a position of some
    difficulty. <i>Signed</i> &mdash;&mdash;</p>

    <p>"P.S.&mdash;What if, when the interesting event occurs,
    17326 Pte. Hogan should be a girl?</p>

    <p>"P.P.S.&mdash;Or twins?"</p>

    <p>Our Albert Edward is just back from one of those Army
    finishing schools where the young subaltern's knowledge of
    SHAKESPEARE and the use of the globes is given a final shampoo
    before he is pushed over the top. Albert Edward's academy was
    situated in a small town where schools are maintained
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> by all our brave Allies; it
       is an educational centre. The French school does the honours
       of the place and keeps a tame band, which gives tongue every
       Sunday evening in the Grand Place. Thither repair all the
       young ladies of the town to hear the music. Thither also
       repair all the young subalterns, also for the purpose of
       hearing the music.</p>

    <p>At the end of every performance the national anthems of all
    our brave Allies are played, each brave Ally standing rigidly
    to attention the while, in compliment to the others. As we have
    a lot of brave Allies these days, all with long national
    war-whoops, this becomes somewhat of a strain.</p>

    <p>One morning the French bandmaster called on the Commandant
    of the English school.</p>

    <p>"Some Americans have arrived," said he. "They are naturally
    as welcome as the sunshine, but" (he sighed) "it means yet
    another national anthem."</p>

    <p>The Commandant sighed and said he supposed so.</p>

    <p>"By the way," said the <i>chef d'orchestre</i>, "what is the
    American national anthem?"</p>

    <p>"'Yankee Doodle,'" replied the Commandant.</p>

    <p>The Chief Instructor said he'd always understood it was
    "Hail, Columbia."</p>

    <p>The Adjutant was of the opinion that "The Star-Spangled
    Banner" filled the bill, while the Quartermaster cast his vote
    for "My country, 'tis of thee."</p>

    <p>The <i>chef d'orchestre</i> thrashed his bosom and rent his
    coiffure. "<i>Dieu!</i>" he wailed, "I can't play all of
    them&mdash;<i>figurez-vous</i>!"</p>

    <p>Without stopping to do any figuring they heartily agreed
    that he couldn't. "Tell you what," said the Commandant at
    length, "write to your music-merchant in Paris and leave it to
    him."</p>

    <p>The <i>chef d'orchestre</i> said he would, and did so.</p>

    <p>Next Sunday evening, as the concert drew to a close, the
    band flung into the <i>Marseillaise</i>, and the subalterns of
    all nations kept to attention. They stood to attention through
    "God Save the King," through the national anthems of Russia,
    Italy, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Belgium, Montenegro and Monte
    Carlo, all our brave Allies. Then the <i>chef d'orchestre</i>
    suddenly sprang upon a stool and waved above his head the
    stripes and stars of our newest brave Ally, while the band
    crashed into the opening strains of "When de midnight choo-choo
    starts for Alabam." It speaks volumes for the discipline of the
    allied armies that their young subalterns stood to attention
    even through that.</p>

    <h2>THE GENTLEST ART.</h2>

    <p>Private Elijah Tiddy looked at his watch. There was still
    half-an-hour to the great moment for which the battalion had
    waited so long. Most of the men had decided to fill up the time
    by eating, drinking or sleeping, but Private Tiddy had two
    other passions in life&mdash;one was his wife, and the other
    the gentle art of letter-writing. At all possible and
    impossible moments Private Tiddy wrote letters home. To some
    men this would have been an impossible moment&mdash;not so to
    Tiddy, who, if he hadn't been first a plumber and then a
    soldier, would have made an inimitable journalist.</p>

    <p>So he sat down as best he could with all that he carried,
    and extracted a letter-case from an inside pocket. It was a
    recent gift from the minister of his parish, who knew and
    shared Tiddy's weakness for the pen, and it filled his soul
    with joy. He fingered the thin sheets of writing-paper
    lovingly, as a musician touches the strings, and thoughtfully
    sucked the indelible pencil which Mrs. Tiddy had bought for him
    as a parting present when she said good-bye to him at the
    bookstall.</p>

    <p>"Dearest Wife," he began. Then at a shout he hastily drew in
    his feet as a man dashed past him with a heavy burden. "I
    nearly got it in the neck a minute ago," he wrote, "but I'm all
    right, and this is a fine place if it wasn't for the noise.
    They never seem to stop screeching and the smoke is fair awful,
    and as soon as you think everything is quiet another comes. I
    am quite alone at this minute, but don't you go for to worry;
    they'll be back soon and then perhaps I'll get a bit of
    something. It's pretty hard where I am sitting and I can't
    write you much of a letter, what with the cramp in my legs and
    the noise and wondering how soon the Sergeant will come and
    tell us to move up nearer our part of the line. I can see some
    of the line, not our bit, from where I am sitting. It's shining
    just lovely in the sun.</p>

    <p>"Dear wife, this isn't a bit like home, but it still makes
    me think of you at our station buying me that pencil and all,
    just as the train come in. I think of you all the time wherever
    I am, but the noise is something cruel, and here comes the
    Sergeant to tell us to prepare. I shan't have time to get a
    drink first; but it don't matter; I'd rather write to you than
    anything; and this pad what the minister gave me is fine. I
    keep it in my left breast pocket. Please tell him it hasn't
    stopped a bit of stuff yet, but I am sure it will soon.
    Remember me to everybody. Love and kisses from your
    Elijah."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Tiddy duly received the letter and shed proud tears at
    the thought of her husband, obviously on the eve of a great
    advance, or even lying out hungry and wounded in No Man's Land
    (she hovered between the alternatives), but still cheery and
    finding time and energy to write to his wife.</p>

    <p>It was only a too observant neighbour who discovered that
    the postmark was London, S.E. But even she has not yet decided
    whether Elijah Tiddy is of intention the biggest liar in the
    East Mudshires, or whether he only saw Waterloo Station with
    the eye of the literary man.</p>

    <h2>THE TOWER THAT PASSED IN THE NIGHT.</h2>

    <p>It was in the beginning of things, when the gunners of the
    new army were very new indeed, and the 0000th Battery had just
    taken up its first position on the Western Front. As soon as
    the guns were satisfactorily placed the O.C. began a careful
    survey of the enemy positions. Slowly he ran his field-glasses
    over the seemingly peaceful landscape, and the first thing he
    noticed was a small, deserted, half-ruined tower with ivy
    hanging in dark masses down its sides.</p>

    <p>"We must have that removed at once," he said to the Captain.
    "It's the very place for an observation post. Probably one of
    their best. How long do you think it will take you to get it
    down?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, we ought to do it in an hour," was the confident
    reply.</p>

    <p>But the hour passed and the tower remained just as peaceful,
    just as suitable for an O.P. as ever. The only change was that
    many other features of the adjacent landscape had been resolved
    into their component parts.</p>

    <p>The battery was disappointed, but not unduly so. They knew
    what was the matter; a couple of hours' work should give them
    the range, and then&mdash;</p>

    <p>But, when evening came and the tower still stood untouched,
    0000th Battery began to be worried indeed. A little more of
    this and they might as well blow themselves up. They would be
    disgraced, a laughing-stock to the whole Front. After hopeless
    arguments and bitter recriminations they turned in with the
    intention of beginning again bright and early in one last
    stupendous effort.</p>

    <p>Great and shattering was their surprise when the dawn showed
    them no tower at all, nothing but a heap of rubble in the midst
    of desolation. The hated O.P. had disappeared in the night.</p>

    <p>0000th Battery rubbed its eyes and wild surmise ran from man
    to man. "An unexploded shell must 'ave gorn orf in the
    night."</p>

    <p>"A mine may 'ave bin laid under 'er, and somethink's touched
    it off, like."</p>

    <p>But the real explanation, stranger still, was supplied later
    by a letter dropped from a Taube flying over the Battery's
    position. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Having noticed with regret that the enemy objected to the
    tower in front of X position, the Ober-Kommando gave orders to
    have it removed, in the interests of the surrounding
    country."</p>

    <h2>DAVID.</h2>

    <p>The War brought about no more awful clash of personalities
    than when it threw David and myself into the same dug-out.
    Myself, I am the normal man&mdash;the man who wishes he were
    dead when he is called in the morning and who swears at his
    servant (1) for calling him; (2) for not calling him. My batman
    has learnt, after three years of war, to subdue feet which were
    intended by nature to be thunderous. His method of calling me
    is the result of careful training. If I am to wake at 7 A.M. he
    flings himself flat on his face outside my dug-out at 6 A.M.
    and wriggles snake-like towards my boots. He extracts these
    painlessly from under last night's salvage dump of tin-hats,
    gas-masks and deflated underclothes, noses out my jacket,
    detects my Sam Browne, and in awful silence bears these to the
    outer air, where he emits, like a whale, the breath which he
    has been holding for the last ten minutes. And meanwhile I
    sleep.</p>

    <p>At 6.55 A.M. he brings back boots, belt and jacket. This
    time he breathes. He walks softly, but he walks. He places the
    boots down firmly. He begins to make little noises. He purrs
    and coughs and scratches his chin, and very gradually the air
    of the dug-out begins to vibrate with life. It is like <i>Peer
    Gynt</i>&mdash;the "Morning" thing on the gramophone, you know;
    he clinks a toothbrush against a mug, he pours out water. It is
    all gradual, <i>crescendo</i>; and meanwhile I am awakening. At
    7 A.M., not being a perfect artist, he generally has to drop
    something; but by that time I am only pretending to be asleep,
    and I growl at him, ask him why he didn't call me an hour ago,
    and then fall asleep again. I get up at eight o'clock and dress
    in silence. If my batman speaks to me I cut myself, throw the
    razor at him, and completely break down. In short, as I say, I
    am the normal man.</p>

    <p>With David it is otherwise. David is a big strong man. He
    blew into my dug-out late one night and occupied the other
    bed&mdash;an affair of rude beams and hard wire-netting. He
    spread himself there in sleep, and silence fell. At dawn next
    morning an awful sound hurled me out of dreams towards my
    revolver. I clutched it in sweating terror, and stared round
    the dug-out with my heart going like a machine-gun. It was not,
    however, a Hun counter-attack. It was David calling for his
    servant. As the first ray of the sun lights the Eastern sky
    David calls for his servant. His servant is a North-countryman.
    Sleeping far off in some noxious haunt, he hears David's voice
    and instantly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> begins to speak. His voice
       comes swelling towards us, talking of boots and tunics. As
       he reaches the dug-out door he becomes deafening. He and
       David have a shouting match. He kicks over a petrol-tin full
       of water, smashes my shaving mirror, and sits on my feet
       while picking up the bits.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile David is standing on his bed and jodelling, while
    his batman shrieks to him that his wife said in her last letter
    to him that if he doesn't get a leaf soon the home'll be bruk
    up. Then David starts slapping soap on to his face like a
    bill-sticker with a paste-brush. His servant drops a field boot
    on to my stomach, trips over an empty biscuit-tin and is heard
    grooming a boot without.</p>

    <p>David now strops his razor. It is one of those self-binding
    safety razors which is all covered with cog-wheels and
    steam-gauges and levers and valves. You feed the strop into it
    like paper into a printing-press, and it eats up the leather as
    low people eat spaghetti, making all the time a noise like a
    mowing-machine. David loves that. He whistles gay tunes while
    it happens. He whistles while he shaves. He cannot whistle
    while brushing his teeth, but he brushes his teeth as a man
    might wash down a cab in a large yard with plenty of room.</p>

    <p>The moment it is over he whistles again. Then he does deep
    breathing at the door of the dug-out. (Aeroplanes passing
    overhead have had narrow escapes from being dragged into the
    dug-out by sheer power of suction, when David deep-breathes.)
    Then he does muscle exercises. He crooks his finger and from
    behind you see a muscle like a mushroom get up suddenly in the
    small of his back, run up his spine and hit him under the left
    ear.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile he is whistling, and his batman is making sparks
    fly out of the buttons, which he cleans with glass-paper and
    gun-cotton just outside the door.</p>

    <p>At eight, when I get carefully out of bed, David is
    beginning to don his shirt. At nine we move together towards
    breakfast.</p>

    <p>I am training David to say "Rah! Rah!" against the day when
    he and General ROOSEVELT meet in a communication trench. I am
    sure they will take to each other at once.</p>

    we learned to-day, employed an auditor who signed the return
    with a mark, like <i>Bill Stumps</i>; while another auditor had
    a habit of signing it in blank and leaving the secretary to
    fill in the figures.</p>

    <p>Mr. ASQUITH used to allow his colleagues so much freedom of
    action that his Administration was nick-named "the
    Go-as-you-please Government"; and eventually it went as he did
    not please. But I cannot recall under his gentle rule anything
    quite so free-and-easy as Mr. HENDERSON'S visit to Paris. That
    a member of the War Cabinet should attend a Conference of
    French and Russian Socialists at all is in itself a
    sufficiently remarkable departure from Ministerial etiquette,
    but that he should be accompanied by Mr. RAMSAY MACDONALD,
    whose peculiar views upon the questions of war and peace have
    so recently been repudiated by the Government and the House of
    Commons, makes it still more extraordinary. In the
    circumstances it was almost surprising to learn that the
    complaisance of the Government did not extend to furnishing Mr.
    MACDONALD with a war-ship for his journey.</p>

    <p>What Mr. BALFOUR, who is responsible for the foreign policy
    of this country, thinks about it all one can only surmise, for
    he said nothing directly on the subject in his great speech
    to-night&mdash;a speech which earned him the unique tribute of
    a compliment from Mr. PRINGLE. But the FOREIGN SECRETARY'S
    warning to the House not to try to anticipate the work of the
    Peace Congress may well have been inspired by apprehensions as
    to what the amateur diplomatists were saying at that moment in
    Paris.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, July 31st.</i>&mdash;An attempt to obtain
    further light on the HENDERSON-MACDONALD excursion met with
    little success. Mr. BONAR LAW professed to see nothing unusual
    in Mr. HENDERSON'S taking part in a Labour Conference, and
    declared, on the somewhat slender ground that only the Allies
    were represented, that it was not of an international
    character. Mr. HOGGE essayed to move the adjournment, but had
    omitted to have his motion ready. The result of his hurried
    effort to draft one was not satisfactory, for the SPEAKER ruled
    that it constituted an attack on Mr. HENDERSON and ought not in
    fairness to be moved until the right hon. gentleman was back in
    his place. So the Government escaped&mdash;for the moment.</p>

    <p>Wearing a jacket suit of Navy blue, and escorted by Lord
    EDMUND TALBOT and Mr. RAWLINSON, the new FIRST LORD OF THE
    ADMIRALTY walked up the floor to take the Oath. Members noted
    with satisfaction the buoyancy of his step and the firmness of
    his chin. If looks go for anything the Navy in his hands will
    not relax the bull-dog grip upon the enemy that it has
    maintained these three years.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Asked whether the Government proposed to institute a
    prosecution in regard to the disturbance of the peace (with
    alleged profane language) that recently occurred within the
    precincts of the Palace of Westminster, Sir GEORGE CAVE gravely
    recited the words of the statute providing that an offender in
    such circumstances was liable to have his right hand stricken
    off. All eyes instinctively turned to see how Mr.
    PEMBERTON-BILLING was taking it; but any anxiety that he may
    have felt was relieved when the HOME SECRETARY added that the
    statute in question was repealed in 1828.</p>

    <p>A question put by Sir HENRY CRAIK about a C1 recruit
    included the statement that he was "suffering from Addison's
    disease"; and Mr. HOGGE voiced the general curiosity when he
    asked, obviously out of solicitude for the late Minister of
    Munitions, "What is ADDISON'S disease?" It is believed that the
    reply, if one had been given, would have been
    "Over-dilution."</p>

    <p>Good progress was made with the Corn Production Bill, and on
    the vexed question as to how far allowances should be reckoned
    as part of the minimum wage an amendment was inserted enabling
    the Wages Boards to secure for the labourer a little more in
    cash and less in kind.</p>

    <p>In the Lords a satisfactory account of the recent
    negotiations between British and German Commissioners at the
    Hague was given by Lord NEWTON. Incidentally he disposed of the
    suggestion that there had been anything in the way of
    fraternization. Both sides had held strictly to the business in
    hand, which was the exchange of prisoners, not of
    compliments.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, August 1st.</i>&mdash;The Peers were to have
    had another field-day, for Lord SELBORNE had put down a motion
    calling attention to the alleged sale of honours. But, to the
    relief of certain of the recently ennobled, who could not be
    sure what the Unnatural History of SELBORNE might contain, the
    discussion was postponed.</p>

    <p>Three hours' talk over Mr. HENDERSON'S dual personality left
    the Commons still vague as to how a Cabinet Minister becomes a
    Labour delegate at will. Perhaps the Channel passage may have
    had something to do with it.</p>

    <h2>THE PICTURE POSTCARDS.</h2>

    <p>A little family party, with an acquaintance or two added,
    sat in deck chairs (at twopence each) at the head of the pier.
    Their complexions proved that there had been sun at
    Brightbourne in some strength. Their noses were already peeling
    a little, and the ladies had bright scarlet patches in the
    <b>V</b> of their blouses. To supply any defects in the
    entertainment provided by the ocean itself they had brought
    paper-covered novels, the two most popular illustrated dailies
    and chocolate. The boy and girl shared <i>Roaring Chips</i> or
    some such comic weekly. The father and his gentleman-friend
    smoked their pipes. All were placid and contented, extending
    their limbs to receive every benediction that sun and sea air
    could confer.</p>

             alt="" /></a>ANY PORT IN A STORM.
    </div>

    <p>A little desultory conversation having
    occurred&mdash;"There's a lady at our boarding-house," said one
    of the acquaintances, "who reads your hand wonderfully," a
    languid argument following on palmistry, in which one of the
    gentlemen disbelieved, but the other had had extraordinary
    experiences of the accuracy of the science&mdash;the mother of
    the boy and girl suddenly remembered that not yet had postcards
    been sent to Auntie and Uncle, Gus and Beatty, Mr. Brown and
    Mrs. Venning.</p>

    <p>"We promised, you know," she said guiltily.</p>

    <p>"Better late than never," said the father's friend
    jocularly.</p>

    <p>"That's right," said the father.</p>

    <p>"Come along," said the gentleman-friend to the boy and girl,
    "we'll go and choose the cards. There's a stall close by," and
    off they started.</p>

    <p>"Don't let them see everything," the prudent mother called
    out, having some acquaintance with the physical trend of the
    moment in postcard humour, which has lost nothing in the
    general moral enfranchisement brought about by the War, one of
    the most notable achievements of which is the death and burial
    of <i>Mrs. Grundy</i>.</p>

    <p>"Go on!" said the boy, with all the laughing scorn of youth.
    "We've seen them all already."</p>

    <p>"You can't keep kids from seeing things nowadays," said the
    father sententiously. "Bring them up well and leave the rest to
    chance, is what I say."</p>

    <p>"Very wise of you," remarked one of the lady-friends.
    "Besides, aren't all things pure to the pure?"</p>

    <p>Having probably a very distinct idea as to the purity of
    many of the postcards which provide Brightbourne with its
    mirth, the father made no reply, but turned his attention to
    the deep-water bathers as they dived and swam and climbed on
    the raft and tumbled off it....</p>

    <p>"Well, let's see what you've got," said the mother as the
    foraging party returned.</p>

    <p>"We've got some beauties," said the daughter&mdash;"real
    screams, haven't we, Mr. Gates?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I think we selected the pick of the bunch," said Mr.
    Gates complacently, speaking as a man of the world who knows a
    good thing when he sees it.</p>

    <p>"My husband's a rare one for fun," said his wife. "A regular
    connoozer."</p>

    <p>"There's a pretty girl at the postcard place," said the boy.
    "Mr. Gates didn't half get off with her, did you?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Gates laughed the laugh of triumph.</p>

    <p>"She's not bad-looking," he said, "but not quite my sort.
    Still&mdash;" He stroked his moustache.</p>

    <p>"Now, Fred," said Mrs. Gates archly, "that'll do; let's see
    the cards."</p>

    <p>"This one," said the girl, "is for Gus. He's been called up,
    you know, so we got him a military one. You see that girl the
    soldier's squeezing? She's rather like his young lady, you
    know, and it says, 'Come down to Brightbourne and learn how to
    carry on.' Gus'll show it to her."</p>

    <p>The mother agreed that it was well chosen.</p>

    <p>"Where's Beatty's?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Here's Beatty's," said the boy; "I chose it. The one with
    the shrimp on it. It says, 'At Breezy Brightbourne. From one
    giddy young shrimp to another.' Jolly clever, isn't it? And
    this is for Mr. Hatton, because he's so fond of beer. You see
    there's a glass of beer, and it says underneath, 'Come where
    the girls are bright and the tonic's all right.' There was
    another one with a bottle called 'The Spirit of Brightbourne,'
    but we thought beer was best."</p>

    <p>"What about Uncle?" the mother asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said the girl, "there's a lovely one for him. Three
    men on their hands and knees licking up the whisky spilt from
    broken bottles."</p>

    <p>"Good Heavens!" said the father, "you can't send him
    that."</p>

    <p>"I think not," said the mother. "If you sent Uncle that, all
    the fat would be in the fire."</p>

    <p>"It's very funny," said the boy.</p>

    <p>"Funny, yes," said the father. "But funniness can be very
    dangerous. Good Heavens!" and he mopped his brow, "you gave me
    quite a turn."</p>

    <p>"Very well, who shall we give it to?" the boy asked. "We
    mustn't waste it."</p>

    <p>"I don't care who has it so long as it's not your Uncle,"
    said the father. "And what have you got for your Aunt
    Tilly?"</p>

    <p>"This one," said the girl. "An old maid looking under the
    bed for a man and hoping she'll find one."</p>

    <p>"Goodness, Maria!" said the father, "are your children mad?
    The idea of sending such a thing to Tilly!"</p>

    <p>"But she is an old maid," said the girl.</p>

    <p>"Of course she is," said the father. "That's the
    mischief."</p>

    <p>"Well, there's rather a good one where a wife is going
    through her husband's trousers and saying, 'Brightbourne's the
    place for change,'" said the girl. "Would that suit?"</p>

    <p>"Of course not," snapped her father.</p>

    <p>"Or the one where the bed is full of fleas?" the boy
    suggested.</p>

    <p>"No jokes about fleas," said the father sternly. "No, you
    must change those for something else. Don't be funny at all
    with either your Uncle or Aunt. We can't run any risks. Send
    them local views&mdash;coloured ones, of course, but strictly
    local."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Gates helped us," said the boy meanly.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Gates doesn't know all the facts," said the father.</p>

    <p>"He can guess one or two of them," said Mr. Gates, jingling
    his pocket.</p>

    <p>"Fred is so quick," said his admiring wife.</p>

    <p>"Well, and what are the others?" the mother asked. "There's
    Mr. Brown and Mrs. Venning. Why shouldn't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> Mr. Brown have the whisky
       one? I'm sure he'd laugh. But you couldn't send Mrs. Venning
       the old maid."</p>

    <p>"We got this for Mr. Brown," said the boy. "The nurse
    bringing the father twins and calling them two 'pink
    forms.'"</p>

    <p>"That's dashed good," said Mr. Gates, "don't you think?"</p>

    <p>"Very smart," said the father. "That's all right. And what
    about Mrs. Venning?"</p>

    <p>"Well," said the girl, "we thought she'd like this
    one&mdash;a man and a woman kissing in a tunnel, and he says
    the tunnel cost ten thousand pounds to make, and she says it's
    worth it, every penny."</p>

    <p>"Very good," said the father; "I like that. Get me another
    of those and I'll send it to a friend of mine in the City. And
    I'll go to the shop myself and help you to choose the local
    views for your Uncle and Aunt Tilly. It's a case where care is
    necessary."</p>

    <h2>THREE DAUGHTERS OF FRANCE.</h2>

    <p><i>Ch&acirc;teau &mdash;&mdash;, France</i>.</p>

    <p><i>To</i> M. PUNCH.</p>

    <p>CHER MONSIEUR,&mdash;Shall I write to you of the toil, the
    fatigues which my sisters and I must endure at the hands of our
    country's Allies, without kindling in your breast that flame of
    chivalry which is the common glory of our two races? <i>C'est
    incroyable</i>.</p>

    <p>Let us then to my complaint.</p>

    <p>We lived for many years, my two sisters and I, in the
    service of our dear master, who owned a beautiful ch&acirc;teau
    in the North of France.</p>

    <p>Our duties were simple&mdash;to entertain the guests of M.
    le Vicomte after dinner on those evenings upon which he
    gathered his friends around him.</p>

    <p>For the rest we lived in the ease which his kind generosity
    knew how to provide. We loved our own particular boudoir, with
    its books, its pictures, its comfortable fauteuils and its soft
    green cushions.</p>

    <p>Oh, Monsieur, it makes me to weep when I think of my
    beautiful sisters&mdash;the one with her laughing rosy cheeks,
    the other pale as ivory, save for one little black spot, which
    no man surely could call a blemish.</p>

    <p>Those were happy days. Often we kissed, my sisters and I,
    for very joy.</p>

    <p>Then it came&mdash;this terrible War. M. le Vicomte was
    called away in the cause of <i>la belle France</i>; but we
    would not desert our home. One day, we said, it shall be as of
    old.</p>

    <p>And as the months went by it was whispered that the English
    would make of our ch&acirc;teau a house of rest for their
    officers who were recovering themselves of their wounds. And we
    were glad, for we promised ourselves to entertain our brave
    Allies. Thus might we too serve <i>la patrie</i>.</p>

    <p>They came. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Is it now a hundred years that
    we hurry to and fro in their service? A House of Rest! <i>Ma
    foi!</i> Morning, noon and night they come, these countrymen of
    yours. Never can we rest. Hither and thither do they drive us.
    No longer are our cushions soft and caressing; the cloth upon
    our table is stained, and see&mdash;here is a hole.</p>

    <p>Ah, it is cruel! Our beauty is decayed. The cheeks of my
    poor sister, that once were so rosy, have lost their colour and
    our figures their rounded grace.</p>

    <p>We are loyal, Monsieur, and, though we are no longer
    pleasing to look upon, we do not grudge our service. But we beg
    of you, kind M. Punch, to procure for us a respite from our
    labours, that we may recover something of our former lustre.
    Thus shall you merit the undying gratitude and your countrymen
    regain the devoted services of what were at one time three of
    France's fairest billiard-balls.</p>

    <h2>THE TWELFTH&mdash;NEW STYLE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Dreamt in a dug-out</i>.)</h4>

    <p>In my dream it was my first Twelfth after the ending of the
    War.</p>

    <p>The party moved off in file up the slope of the moor, Sir
    Percy on his pony in front, then the guests with rifles at the
    trail, next the bearers and orderlies, and in the rear the
    ammunition-limbers and regimental baggage. A ration-party would
    follow later. There was to be no singing on the march, but
    pipes were allowed.</p>

    <p>Just as we neared the crest of the hill, at a notice bearing
    the legend, "Keep below," the whole party entered a deep
    "boyau" leading right up to the trenches in front, from which
    branched off various passages to the gun pits, or butts, as we
    used to call them.</p>

    <p>Our position was semi-circular in form and about
    three-quarters of a mile long; its main strength lay in a chain
    of machine-gun emplacements at intervals of about two hundred
    yards. These were, needless to say, all armoured, but it was
    nevertheless considered bad form to fire along the line.</p>

    <p>Further back there were a couple of Archies and a battery of
    eighteen-pounders.</p>

    <p>Our instructions had been as follows: "At 10 A.M. the
    artillery will open on enemy's main positions with H.E., and at
    the same time the Archies will maintain a barrage along the far
    side, to keep them from breaking away to Smithson's moor (a
    poor sportsman, Smithson; uses lachrymatories. All the birds we
    got off his place last year actually had tears in their eyes
    still). At 10.15 you will open fire with machine guns and
    rifles on anything under three hundred yards. At 10.30 the
    firing will stop and you will make your way to the assembly
    trenches, where bombs will be served out. At 10.35 the entire
    force will advance in open order. No prisoners will be
    taken."</p>

    <p>My personal instructions were to hold my position with two
    men. Hastily lighting a cigarette and adjusting my map-case, I
    was standing-to, when the telephone bell tinkled. "Hello," said
    Sir Percy's voice, "all ready? The planes are out." I glanced
    up at the two 500 h.p. Liddell and Scott monoplanes, which
    circled high up over the moor. "What do they report?" I asked.
    "Birds in force at a.2.B.c.d., x.y.z.6 and A.b.3.m., and small
    parties in and near the Heather Redoubt."</p>

    <p>At 10.30 I left my smoking weapon and an empty flask, and at
    10.35 went over the top. A little later I brought down no fewer
    than seven of the enemy with one beautifully timed bomb, and
    stole a furtive glance at the others. Nobody had seen me do it.
    However, I thought, I shall be able to tell them about it at
    least three times to-night.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile our bearers were collecting the enemy's dead and
    finishing off his wounded. Away to the left Sir Percy and
    half-a-dozen more were gathered round what I took to be the
    Heather Redoubt, and every now and then a little white puff of
    smoke broke from the ground.</p>

    <p>"What's the idea?" I asked over the telephone. "Rabbit
    warren," answered Sir Percy. "Bombing 'em out. I always bomb
    'em out. Smithson uses gas&mdash;poor sportsman, Smithson."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I was dozing lazily in the smoking-room, vaguely wondering
    if I could tell them about it a fourth time, when suddenly the
    dressing gong went, and someone shook me roughly by the
    shoulder. Outside a voice was shouting, "Gas!"</p>

    <p>"Poor sportsman, Smithson," I muttered, struggling into my
    mask.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>EXPERIENCES.</h2>

    <p>There are few of my friends whom I hold in higher respect
    than the Fladworths. Fladworth is a prosperous accountant,
    quite in the front rank of his profession, and for the last
    three years an indefatigable War-worker. His two sons joined up
    on the day War was declared; his three daughters are all
    nursing, and for the last two years their town house has been a
    convalescent home. Mrs. Fladworth is a saint of hospitality,
    and their country house is always full for the week-end with
    people who want a rest. And one can accept this hospitality
    with a good conscience, because they can afford it. It does not
    involve the painful self-sacrifice shown by some people, of
    whom it has been happily said that, when their supplies are
    short, they will insist on your staying for a meal, "even if
    they have to kill a rabbit with a Christian name."</p>

    <p>The Fladworths are charming hosts, but they have a
    weakness&mdash;a passion for intellectual games, serious
    variants, for the most part, on "Consequences," and a most
    trying ordeal for persons who cannot spell or are ignorant of
    history or general information. Moreover, to add to the strain,
    Fladworth is always inventing new games, "so that all may start
    fair." This happened on the occasion of my last visit, when he
    introduced the company to "Experiences." Every one, having
    contributed sixpence to the pool, was expected to describe the
    most interesting or exciting event in his or her life. One of
    the party, who did not compete, then decided which was the best
    experience, and the winner pocketed the pool.</p>

    <p>I cannot remember all the episodes recounted, though they
    were for the most part serious and impressive. Mrs. Fladworth
    had heard Mr. GLADSTONE read the lessons in church; Fladworth
    had heard TENNYSON recite "Come into the Garden, Maud" at a
    friend's house in the Isle of Wight; a young invalid airman,
    who was known to have had the most thrilling adventures, but,
    after the manner of his kind, never talked of his own
    achievements, told us how frightened he had been by the giant
    in his first pantomime. My turn came last, but I was not in the
    least helped by having had the longest time to prepare. I have
    a wonderful memory for futilities, and when called on could
    think of nothing better than my recollection of the arrival of
    <i>Hiawatha</i> at the Channel Islands and the delirium of the
    populace.</p>

    <p>You can imagine my feelings when old Mr. Fladworth,
    <i>&aelig;t.</i> eighty-four and rather deaf, who was acting as
    judge, awarded me the prize on the ground that nothing was more
    interesting than the effect of poetry on the masses. I hadn't
    the courage to explain that it was not LONGFELLOW'S poem, but
    that terrible tarantellating American tune which electrified
    the Channel Islanders some ten years back. As none of the
    company was able or disposed to correct him there was nothing
    left for me to do but to rake in the sixpences. After all, the
    total only amounted to five and sixpence, and I compounded with
    my conscience by putting it in the plate on the following
    morning.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>It was a special duty of the late JOHN F. MACDONALD, who was
    cut off in his prime after incautiously adding to his
    journalistic labours in Paris the voluntary and too exacting
    duties of entertaining the wounded, to emphasize the <i>Entente
    Cordiale</i>. Ever since KING EDWARD laid the foundation of
    that understanding between England and France, it was Mr.
    MACDONALD'S delight as well as his livelihood to study every
    facet of it, both in Paris and in London, and with unfailing
    humour and spirit, fortified by swift insight, to present each
    in turn to his readers. The two best papers in the first volume
    of the posthumous collection of his writings are those which
    describe in vivid kindly strokes the triumphant impact of the
    late KING on the Parisians some fourteen years ago, and the
    visit, not long after, of five hundred London school-children
    to the French capital. Had Mr. MACDONALD been spared to prepare
    this book himself, there is no doubt that he would have
    subjected his essays to revision and brought them into a more
    harmonious whole; but as they stand, gathered together in this
    volume, <i>Two Towns&mdash;One City</i> (GRANT RICHARDS), by
    the proud hands of his mother, they have charm and vitality and
    the authenticity of first-hand knowledge and lively sympathy.
    The War, as we have just been reminded by an impressive
    memorial service, has made deep gaps in the ranks of English
    journalists, and the loss of JOHN F. MACDONALD'S quick eyes,
    happy choice of words, and intensely human apprehensions was
    far from being the least.</p>

    <p>Whether you enjoy <i>The House in Marylebone</i> (DUCKWORTH)
    will depend entirely upon your taste for the society of a
    number of hardworking but sentimental "business girls." For
    this is the whole matter of Mrs. W.K. CLIFFORD'S book. I call
    her girls sentimental, because (for all that they are supposed
    to be chiefly concerned with living their own lives) you will
    be struck at once with the extent to which they contrive to mix
    themselves up with the lives of any male creatures who venture
    over the horizon. "Our little republic," says one of its
    inmates towards the end of the book, "is firmly feminine and
    hasn't done much falling in love." Well, well&mdash;I suppose
    this is a question that turns upon your definition of the word
    "much;" to me personally they seldom seemed to be doing, or
    thinking about, anything else. Nor could I help reflecting how
    much fuller and more vigorous all Mrs. CLIFFORD'S cast would
    have found their existence to-day. Perhaps this feeling
    explains a slight impatience which the society of so much
    struggling femininity eventually produced in me. Young women
    still live in houses in the Marylebone Road; they still
    proclaim republics of hardworking celibacy, and fall briskly in
    love with the first eligible bachelor; but their vocations and
    their citizenship have both (<i>Hoch der KAISER!</i>) grown out
    of all knowledge. So that charming writer, Mrs. CLIFFORD, must
    forgive me if I could find only an historical interest, and no
    very robust one at that, in her amiable retrospect.</p>

    <p>AGNES and EGERTON CASTLE have certainly been well advised
    about their sub-title to <i>The Black Office and other Chapters
    of Romance</i> (MURRAY). For that is precisely what the tales
    are; and excellently romantic and thrilling chapters too, for
    the most part dated in the decade following the great
    Anglo-French peace of a century ago. Probably
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> you couldn't say off-hand
       what the Black Office was. Let me whisper. It was, amongst
       other things, a postal censorship that opened and perused
       all letters intended to cross the Channel. With what natural
       indignation would you, in July three years ago, have read of
       such monstrous activities! Truly, as the authors say, there
       is some interest in the comparison of then and now. Of the
       other stories, my own favourites would he "The
       Resurrectionist" and "The Smile on the Portrait." The first
       of these is a haunting affair of body-snatching, or rather
       of an early escapade of the notorious BURKE, who was asked
       to supply a red-haired corpse, and not finding one produced
       instead a gentleman who had yet to fulfil the condition
       precedent to body-snatching, <i>i.e.</i> who had to be
       killed first and snatched afterwards. This is certainly as
       grim as anything I have met over the Castellated signature.
       Beside it, "The Smile on the Portrait," the tale of a
       jealous husband who becomes a maniac, is almost soothing.
       They had clearly their little worries even a century ago.
       The CASTLES, as everybody knows, have always had the trick
       of adventurous fiction; <i>The Black Office, etc.</i>,
       proves that their hands have lost nothing of their
       cunning.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>One has heard so often of works of "absorbing interest" that
    appeared at "the psychological moment" that one feels a bit
    squeamish about applying these phrases even to such a book as
    Mr. HARRY DE WINDT'S <i>Russia as I Know It</i> (CHAPMAN AND
    HALL); but honestly their appropriateness cannot be denied in
    view of the author's peculiar knowledge of the too mysterious
    country on which interest just now is so poignantly
    concentrated. He has not only traversed Siberia as few, even
    Russians, have done&mdash;that is an old though still thrilling
    story&mdash;but he has ranged at large over the whole country
    from Finland to the Crimea (the only two parts, by the way,
    which he has made me thirst to visit), and has gone with his
    eyes open. In the present volume, touching only incidentally on
    his journeyings and still less on politics, he has tried to
    satisfy the thousand-and-one questioners who, one imagines,
    have been plaguing him not a little lately as to those intimate
    details that really count in the life of a nation. He tells us
    for instance how the Russians do business and keep out the
    cold; how many of the women you could call pretty, and how much
    mutton a Kirghiz can eat. Though some of this is not new, yet
    the book has, as a whole, a most vivid freshness, and, if in
    the end the main effect is to make one content to live out of
    Russia, that is a tribute to the writer's frankness. At the
    least one is able to rejoice in his final verdict of
    unqualified enthusiasm for his hosts, since he found not merely
    acquaintances ready to welcome the popular English, but true
    and trustworthy friends in all classes of the community.</p>

    <p>MRS. OLIVER ONIONS has a light puckish humour and a smooth
    if over-hasty pen, and I don't think she quite does her own
    intelligence (or ours) full justice in <i>The Bridge of
    Kisses</i> (HUTCHINSON). I liked her flapper heroine,
    <i>Joey</i>, and the naughty nephews, the <i>O.U.2's</i>, and
    her sapper lover, <i>The Bridge Builder</i>, who was a
    confoundedly long time over his work, by the way, but
    ultimately came into his own over his own bridge of kisses,
    built under a heavy barrage of needless misunderstandings. But
    <i>Joey's</i> pipsqueak shirker <i>fianc&eacute;</i>,
    <i>Hilary</i>, was altogether too foolish a travesty of a man
    ever to have gained her hand or, having gained it, to have held
    it against any real male in or out of khaki. The fact is that
    "BERTHA RUCK" can achieve something better than these
    meandering methods and this spinelessness of characterisation;
    and it is distinctly disappointing to see her content with the
    curate's egg standard.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It is time that some of our novelists put up a statue to
    NAPOLEON for services rendered to the cause of fiction. In Miss
    MAY WYNNE'S A <i>Spy for Napoleon</i> (JARROLD) his misdeeds
    and those of his minions are made to serve the purpose of
    emphasizing the loyalty of the heroine to her lover. This lover
    was an Englishman of a type sufficiently familiar in
    novels&mdash;cold and masterful, but, for some reason not
    apparent to me, extremely attractive. As he seemed to be
    roaming about France with the object of getting NAPOLEON out of
    the way by any means available, I am not certain that he was
    playing the game, even when we remember that the rules of it
    were lax enough at the beginning of the nineteenth century. But
    we are not asked to weigh carefully the merits of character. It
    is just a romance of incident, in which a hot pace is set at
    the start and kept up to the finish. In short you get a good
    run for your money, and that is all about it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
